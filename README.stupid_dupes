Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stupid_dupes is a shell script that copies the most basic capabilities of
jdupes. It is inefficient. It barely has enough features to be worthy of
using the word "features" at all. Despite all of that, it's pretty safe
and produces the same simple match set printouts as jdupes.

This program illustrates how a duplicate scanner works on a basic level.
It has a minimal set of requirements:

* GNU bash
* find with support for -type and -maxdepth
* stat
* cat
* jodyhash (or any other program that outputs ONLY a hash)
* dd (for partial hashing)

It's slow.

Real slow.

You're welcome.
